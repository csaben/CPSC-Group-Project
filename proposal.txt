Task
For this project, you and your teammates will decide what sort of project you wish to work on. There are some requirements your project must fulfill:

The program must have a graphical user interface.
It must read and write information from/to files.
It must be reasonably complex. This is somewhat difficult to quantify, but the program should not be trivial in nature.
 
Proposal (Due Novermber 10)
You will write a proposal containing the following information:

The name of the project.
The goal of the project â€” what problem it aims to solve.
A list of features your program will contain. You should include brief descriptions of roughly how each one will work.
Your proposal should be around one page long, going into sufficient detail that I get a good sense of what your program will look like.

I will give you feedback on your proposal. I will tell you if your proposal is too ambitious and give advice on scaling it back, or that your proposal is too simplistic and suggest ways of expanding it.
